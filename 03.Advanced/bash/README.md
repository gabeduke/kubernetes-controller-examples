# Custom Controller

While you can script some form of resource monitoring and action-taking using Bash, it's not recommended for anything beyond simple automation tasks. For building a true Kubernetes controller, especially one that manages stateful logic, handles errors gracefully, and operates efficiently within a Kubernetes cluster, using a programming language with a proper Kubernetes client library is the best approach.

## Limitations and Considerations:

- Efficiency: This script polls the Kubernetes API at fixed intervals, which is less efficient than the event-driven watch mechanism provided by Kubernetes client libraries.
- Scalability: As the complexity of what you're monitoring or the actions you need to take increase, maintaining a Bash script could become cumbersome and error-prone.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling is challenging to implement in Bash, especially for the nuanced cases that can occur when interacting with a distributed system like Kubernetes.
- Feature Set: The Kubernetes client libraries for Go, Python, and other languages offer a comprehensive set of features for interacting with the API, managing resources, and handling Kubernetes objects in a structured way, which is not feasible with Bash scripts and kubectl.
